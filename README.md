# Plugin for rest reminders 
>###  by Aristov Vladislav Alexandrovich M3119
 ## This plugin reminds you every hour that you need to relax, stretch, and get away from work. The plugin turns on automatically when the program starts and displays a notification every hour that you need to take a break. The notification also contains a link to a video to warm up your eyes.
